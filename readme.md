###Overview

This is our capstone project for the Code Up Full Stack Bootcamp. We created an online resource for DIY mechanics, similar to StackOverflow. The web app mainly consists of two sections: a tutorials section, which can include videos and pictures to help with the tutorial, and a question and answer section, which acts a thread for getting quick answers. There is also a voting system to rate each component (tutorials, questions, answers, and comments).
